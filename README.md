## About
Muhtar is an universal bot for automating and simplifying business processes via Slack. 
It can be supplemented with any tools that will solve different problems. We use it as a time tracker on projects, but we alao used it as password storage for different services, as mailing tool and many more. 

## How Muhtar works?
Muhtar is written in Java Script. Integration with services is standard via API.

Since we use Slack as a working messenger, Mukhtar is added as a bot to the channels. It tracks all the channels in which it is in and considers that each channel is a project.

Then you can do the following:
In any channel, you can write the command /time, a modal window will open in which you need to fill in the following fields:

- Date
- Which project (selected from the list)
- How many hours did you work?
- What did you do

This information is sent to a Google sheet and database. 

## Who are the users?

1. All the people who work on the project or employees who, for some reason, need to record their time worked. Not only designers/researchers/copywriters, etc., but also managers.
2. Any size company (from small studios to large ones) that need similar employee time tracking.

## What problems Muhtar solves:

1. **The problem of using a complex tool to solve a simple problem**. All communication, including reporting, is carried out in one place using the same tool. People find it more comfortable/easier/more convenient to go to Slack than to go to Jira for example. Jira is complex, scary, bulky. Antway, you still open Slack’s offtopic to look at memes. You’re already in Slack, then record worked time in the neighboring channel. Easy!
2. For small companies, Muhtar can be a **replacement for another external tool**. Also its search, integration, etc.
3. **Unloading the work of managers**. You no longer need to constantly ask your colleagues to fix hours spent on a project.
4. **Helps to solve management problems and assists with reporting**. Helps to track project statuses, labor costs, etc.
